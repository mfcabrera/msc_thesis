      "Huffman coding allows us to build encode using a variable lenght code table based on the frequeency. In the context of word2vec this is the word frequency. This is helpful because allow us to quickly find out the probability of a word using something proportional to $nlog(n)$ as is  a tree. That is the most common terms are stored on the top of the treee making really fast to fetch the probability. AS we will explain later the porabability of this terms is necessary to calculate the window probability.\n",
